To Amelia and whoever else:

The folders labeled Version A, B, and C are the same analysis on the NBA data.  However, different mistakes are present in different versions.

Choose a folder, and explore tha analysis within to find the mistakes.

Notes:

- Don't open "nba_analysis.Rmd"!!!!  This is a master file that generated the versions and solutions.

- There are a couple times my personal path is annoyingly embedded in the .Rmd file.  (Reading the data, and the image for data documentation.)  This is a facet of the versions() function I used to generate these. You'll have to change them. Sorry for the inconvenience; I'll figure this aspect of versions() out at some point.
