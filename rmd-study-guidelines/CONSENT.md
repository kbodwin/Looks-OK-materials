INFORMED CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN A RESEARCH PROJECT:

“Error Identification in Data Science Analysis”

INTRODUCTION 
This form asks for your agreement to participate in a research project on identifying non-obvious errors in data analyses. Your participation involves reviewing a few brief data analyses conducted in R Markdown.  It is expected that your participation will take approximately one hour. There are no risks anticipated with your participation. Others may benefit from your participation through the insights gained into Data Science pedagogy in this study.  If you are interested in participating, please review the following information:

PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND PROPOSED BENEFITS
•	The purpose of the study is to identify the types and quantity of statistical or programming errors most commonly overlooked by Data Scientists.
•	Potential benefits associated with the study include the development of educational strategies for training future Data Scientists to avoid common errors.

YOUR PARTICIPATION
•	If you agree to participate, you will be asked to carefully review a few short writeups analyzing a variety of datasets.  You will be provided a printed copy of each analysis, as well as the interactive R Markdown source code.  You will be asked to identify the errors (if any) in the analyses.  Errors may be in the form of incorrect statistical methods or interpretation, or there may be mistakes in the R code itself.  
•	Your participation will take approximately one hour, in a single online session.
•	If you consent to recording, your session will be recorded, including audio and computer screen recording.  You may be asked follow-up questions about your thought process.

PROTECTIONS AND POTENTIAL RISKS 
•	Please be aware that you are not required to participate in this research, refusal to participate will not involve any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled, and you may discontinue your participation at any time.  
•	During the exit interview, you may omit responses to any questions you choose not to answer. Your responses will be provided anonymously to protect your privacy.
•	Data from this study participation will be anonymized (e.g. de-identified transcripts). Data in its raw form will be stored on secure servers, and will only be accessed by the project investigators.  Data will be stored for at least one year and no more than five years.
