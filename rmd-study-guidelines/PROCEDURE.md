## Process

To evaluate how and how well participants can identify errors in simple data analyses, we will present participants with 2 documents each containing a data analysis about a single topic. Participants have 20 minutes to assess each document and determine if there are any errors, either statistical or programmatical. While doing so, they are asked to verbally share their stream of consciousness. Audio and screen of the participant's computer will be recorded for the duration of the think-aloud. Think-alouds will be recorded and later-on transcribed into text by Ian Flores Siaca and Allison Theobold. 

An investigator will be online over the whole time period of the study. Session hosts will not interfere with the study execution, except to verbally prompt participants to share their thought processes aloud during long periods of silence.  The host investigator will also conduct a brief exit interview.  No identifying questions will be asked during this interview; instead, open-ended questions will be used to prompt the participant to discuss their thought process.  For example:

•	“You identified a coding error in the bar plot visualizations in the first analysis.  Can you talk me through how you arrived at that conclusion?”
•	“Was there a particular section of the second analysis that you struggled to understand?  How did you approach this challenge?”

Study materials are provided as supplemental material to this proposal.


## Safety and anonymity precautions:

Participants will be required to remove any personal identifying information from their computer screens during the recording (e.g., close email applications or websites, turn off chat applications, etc). Each participant’s name will appear in the upper right-hand corner of the RStudio Cloud application being used to disseminate the interview materials (described in the subsequent section). 

Following each interview, the video and audio files will be processed to ensure participant anonymity, using the following process:
•	Each participant will be assigned an identification code
•	Video recordings of participants’ screens will be blurred using an image processing script written in Python
•	Audio recordings of the interviews will be trimmed to eliminate any references to the participant’s name 

A table with the participant’s names and associated identification code will be stored on an encrypted detachable hard drive. Only members of the research team included on this IRB will be permitted to access this table. The anonymized audio and video files will be stored in a web-based shared folder, so that the members of the research team are able to readily access them throughout the transcription and analysis process. 

Following the close of the project, the audio and video files will be transferred to the encrypted detachable hard drive. Data from the study will be stored for at least one year, and for no more than five years.


## Technical Details

These documents will be administered using RStudio Cloud, a hosted online service operated by RStudio, PBC. To administer the consent forms a LimeSurvey application (https://www.limesurvey.org/) will be deployed in Digital Ocean (https://digitalocean.com) with an instance hosted in the San Francisco, California, United States region and another instance hosted in the Toronto, Ontario, Canada region. Once participants voluntarily agree to participate in the study, the link for their individual RStudio Cloud Workspace will be provided and they will have the documents at their disposal.
